You can use an organization to collaborate with other people on Replicate.

Organizations let you share access to models, API tokens, billing, dashboards, and more. When you run models as the organization, it gets billed to your shared credit card instead of your personal account.

You can also use organizations to create [private models](/docs/topics/models/private-models) that are only visible to people on your team.

To get started, use the account menu to create your organization:
