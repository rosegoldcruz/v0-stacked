Open-source is a big deal at Replicate.

One of our goals as a team has always been to help unlock the power of machine learning by building flexible and well-designed open-source tools. We’re motivated by the experimentation and innovation that happens when ideas can grow beyond the confines of academic papers and take life as reproducible, open-source code.

This page highlights some of the open-source projects and tools we maintain. For the full list, see the [@replicate](https://github.com/replicate) organization on GitHub.
