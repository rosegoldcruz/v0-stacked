[](#authentication)Authentication
---------------------------------

All API requests must include a valid API token in the `Authorization` request header. The token must be prefixed by “Bearer”, followed by a space and the token value. Example: `Authorization: Bearer r8_Hw***********************************` Find your tokens at [https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)

[](#predictions.create)Create a prediction
------------------------------------------

### [](#predictions.create-endpoint)Endpoint

Copy

```plaintext
POST https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions
```

### [](#predictions.create-description)Description

Create a prediction for the model version and inputs you provide.

If you’re running an [official model](https://replicate.com/collections/official), use the [`models.predictions.create`](#models.predictions.create) operation instead.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```shell
curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \
  -d '{"version": "replicate/hello-world:5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa", "input": {"text": "Alice"}}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions
```

The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

For a complete overview of the `predictions.create` API check out our documentation on [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) which covers a variety of use cases.

### [](#predictions.create-headers)Headers

*   [Prefer](#predictions.create-headers-prefer)string
    
    Leave the request open and wait for the model to finish generating output. Set to `wait=n` where n is a number of seconds between 1 and 60.
    
    See https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction#sync-mode for more information.
    

### [](#predictions.create-request-body)Request Body

*   [input](#predictions.create-request-body-input)objectRequired
    
    The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you are running or [get the model version](#models.versions.get) and look at its `openapi_schema` property. For example, [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as an input.
    
    Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.
    
    Use an HTTP URL when:
    
    *   you have a large file > 256kb
    *   you want to be able to use the file multiple times
    *   you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files
    
    Use a data URL when:
    
    *   you have a small file <= 256kb
    *   you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
    *   you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)
    
*   [version](#predictions.create-request-body-version)stringRequired
    
    The ID of the model version that you want to run. This can be specified in two formats:
    
    1.  Just the 64-character version ID: `9dcd6d78e7c6560c340d916fe32e9f24aabfa331e5cce95fe31f77fb03121426`
    2.  Full model identifier with version ID in the format `{owner}/{model}:{id}`. For example, `replicate/hello-world:9dcd6d78e7c6560c340d916fe32e9f24aabfa331e5cce95fe31f77fb03121426`
    
*   [stream](#predictions.create-request-body-stream)boolean
    
    **This field is deprecated.**
    
    Request a URL to receive streaming output using [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).
    
    This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.
    
*   [webhook](#predictions.create-request-body-webhook)string
    
    An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the response body of the [get prediction](#predictions.get) operation. If there are network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve without redirecting.
    
*   [webhook\_events\_filter](#predictions.create-request-body-webhookeventsfilter)array
    
    By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction request:
    
    *   `start`: immediately on prediction start
    *   `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions can generate multiple outputs)
    *   `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
    *   `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state (succeeded/canceled/failed)
    
    For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the prediction, you would provide:
    
    {
      "version": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",
      "input": {
        "text": "Alice"
      },
      "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
      "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
    }
    
    Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every 500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be sent regardless of throttling.
    

[](#predictions.get)Get a prediction
------------------------------------

### [](#predictions.get-endpoint)Endpoint

Copy

```plaintext
GET https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/{prediction_id}
```

### [](#predictions.get-description)Description

Get the current state of a prediction.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```shell
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu
```

The response will be the prediction object:

Copy

```json
{
  "id": "gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu",
  "model": "replicate/hello-world",
  "version": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",
  "input": {
    "text": "Alice"
  },
  "logs": "",
  "output": "hello Alice",
  "error": null,
  "status": "succeeded",
  "created_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.765994Z",
  "data_removed": false,
  "started_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.779176Z",
  "completed_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.791859Z",
  "metrics": {
    "predict_time": 0.012683
  },
  "urls": {
    "web": "https://replicate.com/p/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu",
    "get": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu",
    "cancel": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu/cancel"
  }
}
```

`status` will be one of:

*   `starting`: the prediction is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a few seconds, then it’s typically because a new worker is being started to run the prediction.
*   `processing`: the `predict()` method of the model is currently running.
*   `succeeded`: the prediction completed successfully.
*   `failed`: the prediction encountered an error during processing.
*   `canceled`: the prediction was canceled by its creator.

In the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You’ll need to pass the `Authorization` header to request them.

In the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the prediction.

Terminated predictions (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`) will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the prediction used while running. It won’t include time waiting for the prediction to start.

All input parameters, output values, and logs are automatically removed after an hour, by default, for predictions created through the API.

You must save a copy of any data or files in the output if you’d like to continue using them. The `output` key will still be present, but it’s value will be `null` after the output has been removed.

Output files are served by `replicate.delivery` and its subdomains. If you use an allow list of external domains for your assets, add `replicate.delivery` and `*.replicate.delivery` to it.

### [](#predictions.get-parameters)URL Parameters

*   [prediction\_id](#predictions.get-parameters-predictionid)stringRequired
    
    The ID of the prediction to get.

[](#models.get)Get a model
--------------------------

### [](#models.get-endpoint)Endpoint

Copy

```plaintext
GET https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/{model_owner}/{model_name}
```

### [](#models.get-description)Description

Example cURL request:

Copy

```shell
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world
```

The response will be a model object in the following format:

Copy

```json
{
  "url": "https://replicate.com/replicate/hello-world",
  "owner": "replicate",
  "name": "hello-world",
  "description": "A tiny model that says hello",
  "visibility": "public",
  "github_url": "https://github.com/replicate/cog-examples",
  "paper_url": null,
  "license_url": null,
  "run_count": 5681081,
  "cover_image_url": "...",
  "default_example": {...},
  "latest_version": {...},
}
```

The model object includes the [input and output schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi#model-schemas) for the latest version of the model.

Here’s an example showing how to fetch the model with cURL and display its input schema with [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

Copy

```shell
curl -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
    https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world \
    | jq ".latest_version.openapi_schema.components.schemas.Input"
```

This will return the following JSON object:

Copy

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "title": "Input",
  "required": [
    "text"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "text": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Text",
      "x-order": 0,
      "description": "Text to prefix with 'hello '"
    }
  }
}
```

The `cover_image_url` string is an HTTPS URL for an image file. This can be:

*   An image uploaded by the model author.
*   The output file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a cover image.
*   The input file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a cover image and the example prediction has no output file.
*   A generic fallback image.

The `default_example` object is a [prediction](#predictions.get) created with this model.

The `latest_version` object is the model’s most recently pushed [version](#models.versions.get).

### [](#models.get-parameters)URL Parameters

*   [model\_owner](#models.get-parameters-modelowner)stringRequired
    
    The name of the user or organization that owns the model.
    
*   [model\_name](#models.get-parameters-modelname)stringRequired
    
    The name of the model.

DELETE https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/{model_owner}/{model_name}
```

### [](#models.delete-description)Description

Delete a model

Model deletion has some restrictions:

*   You can only delete models you own.
*   You can only delete private models.
*   You can only delete models that have no versions associated with them. Currently you’ll need to [delete the model’s versions](#models.versions.delete) before you can delete the model itself.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```shell
curl -s -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world
```

The response will be an empty 204, indicating the model has been deleted.

### [](#models.delete-parameters)URL Parameters

*   [model\_owner](#models.delete-parameters-modelowner)stringRequired
    
    The name of the user or organization that owns the model.
    
*   [model\_name](#models.delete-parameters-modelname)stringRequired
    
    The name of the model.
    

[](#models.examples.list)List examples for a model
--------------------------------------------------

### [](#models.examples.list-endpoint)Endpoint

Copy

```plaintext
GET https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/{model_owner}/{model_name}/examples
```

### [](#models.examples.list-description)Description

List [example predictions](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/models/publish-a-model#what-are-examples) made using the model. These are predictions that were saved by the model author as illustrative examples of the model’s capabilities.

If you want all the examples for a model, use this operation.

If you just want the model’s default example, you can use the [`models.get`](#models.get) operation instead, which includes a `default_example` object.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```shell
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world/examples
```

The response will be a pagination object containing a list of example predictions:

Copy

```json
{
  "next": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world/examples?cursor=...",
  "previous": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world/examples?cursor=...",
  "results": [...]
}
```

Each item in the `results` list is a [prediction object](#predictions.get).

### [](#models.examples.list-parameters)URL Parameters

*   [model\_owner](#models.examples.list-parameters-modelowner)stringRequired
    
    The name of the user or organization that owns the model.
    
*   [model\_name](#models.examples.list-parameters-modelname)stringRequired
    
    The name of the model.
    

[](#models.predictions.create)Create a prediction using an official model
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#models.predictions.create-endpoint)Endpoint

Copy

```plaintext
POST https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/{model_owner}/{model_name}/predictions
```

### [](#models.predictions.create-description)Description

Create a prediction using an [official model](https://replicate.com/changelog/2025-01-29-official-models).

If you’re _not_ running an official model, use the [`predictions.create`](#predictions.create) operation instead.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```shell
curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \
  -d '{"input": {"prompt": "Write a short poem about the weather."}}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct/predictions
```

The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

For a complete overview of the `deployments.predictions.create` API check out our documentation on [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) which covers a variety of use cases.

### [](#models.predictions.create-parameters)URL Parameters

*   [model\_owner](#models.predictions.create-parameters-modelowner)stringRequired
    
    The name of the user or organization that owns the model.
    
*   [model\_name](#models.predictions.create-parameters-modelname)stringRequired
    
    The name of the model.
    

### [](#models.predictions.create-headers)Headers

*   [Prefer](#models.predictions.create-headers-prefer)string
    
    Leave the request open and wait for the model to finish generating output. Set to `wait=n` where n is a number of seconds between 1 and 60.
    
    See https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction#sync-mode for more information.
    

### [](#models.predictions.create-request-body)Request Body

*   [input](#models.predictions.create-request-body-input)objectRequired
    
    The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you are running or [get the model version](#models.versions.get) and look at its `openapi_schema` property. For example, [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as an input.
    
    Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.
    
    Use an HTTP URL when:
    
    *   you have a large file > 256kb
    *   you want to be able to use the file multiple times
    *   you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files
    
    Use a data URL when:
    
    *   you have a small file <= 256kb
    *   you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
    *   you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)
    
*   [stream](#models.predictions.create-request-body-stream)boolean
    
    **This field is deprecated.**
    
    Request a URL to receive streaming output using [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).
    
    This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.
    
*   [webhook](#models.predictions.create-request-body-webhook)string
    
    An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the response body of the [get prediction](#predictions.get) operation. If there are network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve without redirecting.
    
*   [webhook\_events\_filter](#models.predictions.create-request-body-webhookeventsfilter)array
    
    By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction request:
    
    *   `start`: immediately on prediction start
    *   `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions can generate multiple outputs)
    *   `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
    *   `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state (succeeded/canceled/failed)
    
    For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the prediction, you would provide:
    
    {
      "input": {
        "text": "Alice"
      },
      "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
      "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
    }
    
    Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every 500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be sent regardless of throttling.

[](#deployments.predictions.create)Create a prediction using a deployment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [](#deployments.predictions.create-endpoint)Endpoint

Copy

```plaintext
POST https://api.replicate.com/v1/deployments/{deployment_owner}/{deployment_name}/predictions
```

### [](#deployments.predictions.create-description)Description

Create a prediction for the deployment and inputs you provide.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```shell
curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \
  -d '{"input": {"prompt": "A photo of a bear riding a bicycle over the moon"}}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/deployments/acme/my-app-image-generator/predictions
```

The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

For a complete overview of the `deployments.predictions.create` API check out our documentation on [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) which covers a variety of use cases.

### [](#deployments.predictions.create-parameters)URL Parameters

*   [deployment\_owner](#deployments.predictions.create-parameters-deploymentowner)stringRequired
    
    The name of the user or organization that owns the deployment.
    
*   [deployment\_name](#deployments.predictions.create-parameters-deploymentname)stringRequired
    
    The name of the deployment.
    

### [](#deployments.predictions.create-headers)Headers

*   [Prefer](#deployments.predictions.create-headers-prefer)string
    
    Leave the request open and wait for the model to finish generating output. Set to `wait=n` where n is a number of seconds between 1 and 60.
    
    See https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction#sync-mode for more information.
    

### [](#deployments.predictions.create-request-body)Request Body

*   [input](#deployments.predictions.create-request-body-input)objectRequired
    
    The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you are running or [get the model version](#models.versions.get) and look at its `openapi_schema` property. For example, [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as an input.
    
    Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.
    
    Use an HTTP URL when:
    
    *   you have a large file > 256kb
    *   you want to be able to use the file multiple times
    *   you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files
    
    Use a data URL when:
    
    *   you have a small file <= 256kb
    *   you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
    *   you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)
    
*   [stream](#deployments.predictions.create-request-body-stream)boolean
    
    **This field is deprecated.**
    
    Request a URL to receive streaming output using [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).
    
    This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.
    
*   [webhook](#deployments.predictions.create-request-body-webhook)string
    
    An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the response body of the [get prediction](#predictions.get) operation. If there are network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve without redirecting.
    
*   [webhook\_events\_filter](#deployments.predictions.create-request-body-webhookeventsfilter)array
    
    By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction request:
    
    *   `start`: immediately on prediction start
    *   `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions can generate multiple outputs)
    *   `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
    *   `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state (succeeded/canceled/failed)
    
    For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the prediction, you would provide:
    
    {
      "input": {
        "text": "Alice"
      },
      "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
      "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
    }
    
    Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every 500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be sent regardless of throttling.

As models can take several minutes or more to train, the result will not be available immediately. To get the final result of the training you should either provide a `webhook` HTTPS URL for us to call when the results are ready, or poll the [get a training](#trainings.get) endpoint until it has finished.

When a training completes, it creates a new [version](https://replicate.com/docs/how-does-replicate-work#terminology) of the model at the specified destination.

To find some models to train on, check out the [trainable language models collection](https://replicate.com/collections/trainable-language-models).

}
```

`status` will be one of:

*   `starting`: the training is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a few seconds, then it’s typically because a new worker is being started to run the training.
*   `processing`: the `train()` method of the model is currently running.
*   `succeeded`: the training completed successfully.
*   `failed`: the training encountered an error during processing.
*   `canceled`: the training was canceled by its creator.

In the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You’ll need to pass the `Authorization` header to request them.

In the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the training.

Terminated trainings (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`) will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the training used while running. It won’t include time waiting for the training to start.

[](#rate-limits)Rate limits

We limit the number of API requests that can be made to Replicate:

*   You can call [create prediction](#create-a-prediction) at 600 requests per minute.
*   All other endpoints you can call at 3000 requests per minute.

If you hit a limit, you will receive a response with status `429` with a body like:

{"detail":"Request was throttled. Expected available in 1 second."}
```
