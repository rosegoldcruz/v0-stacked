Aeon Investments Technologies LLC is building a comprehensive AI-driven social media automation platform—code-named TikTok Automation Engine—designed to generate, optimize, and schedule vertical video content at scale. Leveraging Hailuo AI, Runway Gen-4, CapCut, and open-source video generators, the system will produce high-performing 9:16 shorts across multiple niches (men’s lifestyle, women’s beauty, luxury living, technology, finance, sports betting, and YouTube storytelling for older demographics). The platform integrates a custom orchestration layer, backend microservices, and a React/TypeScript dashboard to monitor trends, analyze engagement, and track revenue. Containerized deployments on DigitalOcean and Hostinger ensure scalability and compliance. The ultimate goal is to autonomously drive the platform to $10 million in annual revenue through seamless monetization, affiliate partnerships, and data-driven content strategies.

Project Background and Objectives

Monetization Target: Achieve $10 million in annual recurring revenue within 12 months of launch.

Automation: Minimize manual intervention by automating content generation, metadata enrichment, trend analysis, and scheduling.

Scalability: Architect the system for horizontal scaling to handle thousands of video clips per day.

Compliance: Ensure all data acquisition and publishing workflows comply with platform TOS and privacy regulations.

Modularity: Build loosely coupled components to allow rapid iteration, niche expansion, and third-party integrations.

High-Level Architecture

1. Orchestration Layer (Build-Time vs. Runtime)

Build-Time Scaffolding: Utilize Codex CLI internally to generate file structures, boilerplate code, and CI/CD pipelines.

Runtime Scheduler: Implement a custom Node.js/Python CLI that triggers AI pipelines, scrapes public feeds, and enqueues video generation jobs.

2. AI Content Pipelines

Input Data Acquisition:

Public website scraping (legal, TOS-friendly) for trending hashtags, headlines, and keywords.

RSS feeds and legal APIs (e.g., Google Trends, Reddit, Twitter) to detect emerging topics.

OddsAPI integration for sports betting data streams.

Script & Scene Generation:

Use Hailuo AI’s I2V&T2V-01-DIRECTOR model to generate 6–10 second cinematic clips with synchronized narration.

Employ Runway Gen-4 for highly photo-realistic B-roll segments optimized for TikTok.

Editing & Styling:

Automatically apply trending TikTok templates (transitions, filters, captions) via CapCut automation APIs.

Generate on-brand overlays and calls to action.

Metadata Enrichment:

Auto-generate hashtags, titles, and descriptions based on NLP analysis of trending content.

A/B test variants within the content calendar.

3. Backend Services

Trend Monitoring Service (Python + Supabase Functions): Continuously fetches and analyzes data to identify high-potential viral topics.

Analytics Engine (Node.js + PostgreSQL): Ingests engagement metrics (views, likes, shares) via TikTok Creator Marketplace API once access is approved.

Financial Integration (Bank of America API): Securely logs revenue, affiliate payouts, and ad earnings into the Aeon Investments Tech accounting dashboard.

4. Frontend Dashboard (React/TypeScript)

Performance Metrics: Interactive charts for daily/weekly video performance, niche-level breakdowns, and revenue attribution.

Content Calendar: Drag-and-drop scheduling interface with preview thumbnails and status indicators (queued, in production, published).

AI Pipeline Control Panel: Configure Hailuo, Runway, and CapCut parameters; launch manual generation jobs if needed.

User Management: Role-based access for internal teams and external partners.

5. Infrastructure & Deployment

Containerization: Dockerized microservices and AI pipeline workers.

Hosting: DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster for backend; Hostinger shared hosting for dashboard static assets.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, and deploy phases.

Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus for system health, Grafana dashboards, and centralized log aggregation (ELK stack).

Functional Requirements

Automated Trend Discovery:

Frequency: Every 15 minutes

Source Compliance: Only from TOS-approved public endpoints

Video Generation Workflow:

Input: Trend data + niche configuration

Output: Rendered 9:16 .mp4 files with captions and metadata

Throughput: Minimum 100 videos/day at launch, scalable to 1,000 videos/day

Scheduling & Publishing:

Schedule content across multiple TikTok business accounts

Integrate with TikTok API upon approval; fallback to manual upload instructions if delayed

Dashboard Features:

Real-time KPI updates (1–5 second delays)

Customizable alert thresholds (e.g., drops in engagement)

Export CSV and PDF reports for investor presentations

Non-Functional Requirements

Security:

SOC 2 compliance for data handling

Encrypted secrets storage (Vault or AWS KMS)

Reliability:

99.9% uptime SLA

Automated failover for critical services

Performance:

AI pipeline job startup latency < 30 seconds

Dashboard load time < 2 seconds for 95th percentile users

Maintainability:

Modular codebase with clear service boundaries

Comprehensive test coverage (> 80% unit and integration tests)

Legal and Compliance Considerations

Data Acquisition: Strictly abide by robots.txt and API TOS for all scraped sites.

Content Disclosure: Clearly label AI-generated videos per FTC guidelines.

Sports Betting: Limit distribution to jurisdictions with legal sports betting; include disclaimers and age gating.

Financial Transactions: Ensure all Bank of America API calls comply with banking terms and PCI DSS for any card data.
